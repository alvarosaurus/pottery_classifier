    "Digitization of museum collections is currently a major challenge faced by culturage heritage and natural history museums. Museums are expected to digitize the collections to improve not only the documentation of artefacts, but also their availability for research, reconstruction and outreach activities, and to make these digital representations available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "While 2D-digitalization, achieved through high resolution 2D-scans and photographs, e.g. of paintings, is a well understood process, 3D-digitalization of archaeological or natural history artefacts remains costly and time-consuming: at the time of writing, digitizing an artefact can take several hours including post-processing, therefore digitization is currently reserved for the most prestigious items in the collection. Efforts towards enabling a cost-efficient and timely mass-digitalization of _all_ the artefacts in a collection are underway, e.g. at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research IGD](https://www.igd.fraunhofer.de/en/competences/technologies/3d-scanning), at the [Forschungs- und Kompetenzzentrum Digitalisierung Berlin](https://www.digis-berlin.de/) and at [Museum für Naturkunde Berlin](https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/museum/exhibitions/live-digitization) (fig. 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "Discussions with the [digitization](https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/museum/exhibitions/live-digitization) manager at Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (MfN) and with the contractor who provides the [3D-scanning technology](https://picturae.com/en/) at MfN show that there is a need for an automated method for extracting information from the scans. The Senate Department for Science, Research and Culture, Berlin, has setup a [funding programme](https://www.berlin.de/sen/kultur/kulturpolitik/kulturelle-teilhabe/digitalisierung/digitalisierung-von-objekten/) to facilitate digitalization of museum collections in Berlin, therefore the funding and employement opportunities in this sector are excellent. \n",

    "After an artefact has been digitized, it needs to be classified in order to enable the creation of new online services for research, restauration or outreach. Classification of raw, \"point cloud\", data according to a pre-defined typology is an open problem, and I argue that machine learning techniques offer a promising approach to solving it. When scanning a large number of artefacts (the curent target at Museum für Naturkunde Berlin is several thousand each day), it becomes impractical to manually input the metadata for each 3D-model. Therefore, classification software can help to generate metadata according to a pre-defined typology, to enable later retrieval of the digital files."

    "In order to train a classifier, a large dataset has to be available, and it has to be labeled or described in sufficient detail. As this problem is at the cutting edge of museum technology, such datasets are scarce.

    "Ceramics are an ubiquituous product of any pre-industrial culture. Ceramics have been used as containers and for transport of goods, as everyday utensils for cooking, drinking and eating, or as decorative objects, and can be found on archaeological sites in sufficient numbers to allow for statistical study (fig. 2). \n",

The [typology of Greek pot shapes](https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/carc/resources/Introduction-to-Greek-Pottery/Shapes), comprises more than a hundred standardized forms. Pottery was a medium for painting and is often decorated with sophisticated scenes.\n",
